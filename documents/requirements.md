# Goal

People know stuff, but it can be hard to share what they know and it can be hard to find people with certain knowledge.
Since the A in ZAM stands for "(idea/knowledge/...) exchange" it wants to facilitate the sharing of knowledge.
Unfortunately it can be hard to specify what one knows and how deep the knowledge is. A good indicator of knowledge are past projects, though.
The Wissenslandkarte (WLK) or knowledge map offers an easy way of documenting projects and thus knowledge and finding people by their knowledge.

# Definitions
